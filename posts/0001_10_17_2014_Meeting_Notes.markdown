十月十七号的课:

语法：“A跟B verb”

    The word 跟 (gen) can be used to connect two pronouns together to express
that they shared in doing a verb.

    “A跟B一样高.” “A gen B yiyang gao.”

Can also be used to compare two or more nouns with each other. As in “this city
and that city are the same size.”

    “A对B不感兴趣.” “A dui B bu gan xingqu.”

The word 对 dui , aside from meaning “right” can also express the direction or
receiver of an action or feeling. In the example above, the sentence could be
translated as “ A towards B doesn't feel interest.”


    “A看起来adjective” “A kanqilai adjective.”

This grammar structure, 看起来 kanqilai, means to look like. But be careful,
this is not the same as “seems like”. This can be used to describe what is being
observed with any of the five senses. Just take a sensing verb, such as 听ting
and add it to 起来qilai to form the structure. If you want to use this to
express that something looks, sounds or senses similarly to a noun you need to
add 像Xiang.

    “A看起来像noun一样“A kanqilai xiang yiyang.”

This can be literally translated to “(A) looks like (noun) the same.”

成语(chengyu)：

    “你看起来闷闷不乐的样子“

This phrase 闷闷不乐menmenbule is an idiom which means “gloomy”or “depressed”.
At the end of the sentence there is the word 樣子yangzi which loosely translates
to “likeness.”The above sentence literally translated is “You look like
depressed looking,”
